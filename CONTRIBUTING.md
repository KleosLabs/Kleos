# Contributing to Kleos

Thank you for considering contributing to **Kleos**. 

Kleos is still in its early stages: modular, interpretive, and observant by design. If youâ€™re interested in shaping how it watches, thinks, or surfaces behavior, we welcome your contributions.


## Getting Started

1. **Fork** the repository.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Kleos.git
   cd Kleos
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:

   * For TypeScript:

     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   * For Python:

     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
4. **Create a new branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-name
   ```

## Guidelines

* **Follow TypeScript conventions and linting** (Prettier + ESLint)
* **Keep agent logic modular, typed, and minimal**
* **Write clear, meaningful commit messages**
* **Document public methods and components**
* **Test your changes** if applicable
