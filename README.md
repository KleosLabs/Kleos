# Kleos Labs

A network of interpretive agents observing latent behavior across Solana’s movement layer. 

Kleos is a modular intelligence system for decoding behavioral movement on-chain, surfacing rituals, unfinished actions, and silent coordination. Built for those tracing signal beneath structure.

## What is Kleos?

Kleos is a modular agent designed to:
- Analyze movement and behavioral patterns across Solana's execution layer
- Detect on-chain ritualistic flows, entry logic, and incomplete cycles
- Connect wallet behavior to protocol-level intent
- Surface behavioral signals often discarded by dashboards

Not a filter. Not a score.
Kleos reads the chain as memory. Nothing more.

## Core Modules

### Scroll Engine
Transforms raw wallet behavior into evolving scrolls.  
Each scroll reflects a phase of movement or intent: readable, interpretable, archetypal.

### Pulse Feed
Tracks attention rotation across Solana protocols and tokens.  
Detects early surges, rotations, and silent entries. Not volume, alignment.

### Memory Map
Detects unfinished journeys.  
Mints that weren’t sold. Bridges that weren’t used. Liquidity added, then left untouched.  
The chain remembers what most dashboards discard.

### EchoNet
Maps synchronized movement between addresses.  
Not copy-trading. Echo behavior.  
Find subtle social flows, alpha syndicates, and behavioral resonance.

### Enrichment Layer
Connects addresses to off-chain patterns. GitHub repos, Farcaster posts, Twitter follows.  
Not doxxing. Signal alignment.

## Tech Stack

- Core Frameworks: TypeScript (agents), Python (classification services)
- Frontend: Tailwind CSS, React
- Chain Interface: Helius RPC, custom Solana indexers, native event triggers
- Agent Logic: Typed detection modules (TypeScript), behavioral models (Scikit-learn in Python)
- AI Layer: LangChain, for scroll narration and contextual summaries
- Dev Environment: ESLint, Prettier, tsx, Pyright, modular test runners

## Example Classification

An example sequence observed and classified by Kleos:

```ts
// Enters via Jupiter. Bridges. Swaps into low-liquidity. Leaves no trace.

const walletActivity = {
  entry: "Jupiter",
  actions: ["bridge", "swap_low_liquidity"],
  followUp: null,
};

const classification = kleos.classify(walletActivity);

console.log(classification);
// "Moved like a whisper. Entered between tides. Did not return."

```

## Status

Modular prototype.  
Under active development.  
Open to contributors aligned with the ethos.
